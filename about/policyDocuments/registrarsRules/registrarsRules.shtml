   <strong> Documents in Schedule 2 form delivered under the Companies Act 2006</strong> </p>
  <p><strong>Application of Chapter</strong> </p>

  <p> (2) For some legislative provisions there is more than one Schedule 2 form. The top of a Schedule 2 form refers to the circumstances in which it is to be used.</p>
  <p><strong>Welsh language forms </strong></p>

  <p> (2) A continuation form is to be used to continue the information inserted in a Schedule 2 form in the circumstances indicated on that Schedule 2 form. Where there is more than one continuation form for a particular Schedule 2 form the type of information to be continued determines which continuation form is to be used.<br>
    <br>

  <p> (2) A Schedule 2 form to which this rule applies must contain the barcode indicated on that form in Schedule 2.</p>
  <p> (3) A person reproducing that form for delivery to the registrar can obtain an image of the barcode from the registrar.</p>
  <p> (4) The barcode must be included in the Schedule 2 form in the format supplied by the registrar including it being in black ink, 13.5 mm high and 70.5 mm wide.</p>
  <p> (5) The barcode must be set out in the location indicated on the Schedule 2 form being as follows-</p>

    <li>(b) 47.5mm from the top edge of the page,</li>
    <li>(c) 236mm from the bottom of the page; and </li>
    <li>(d) 98.55mm from the right edge of the page.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Orange coloured forms to be obtained from the registrar</strong></p>
  <p>    15. A document for which a form is provided in Part 3 of Schedule 2 must be delivered to the registrar on a form obtained from the registrar because the form must be on orange coloured paper. </p>

  <p><strong>Chapter 2<br>
    Documents in Schedule 7 form delivered under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000 </strong></p>
  <p><strong>Application of Chapter </strong></p>
  <p>    72. This Chapter imposes requirements as to the use of a Schedule 7 form for specified documents delivered to the registrar under the LLP Act. </p>
  <p><strong>Schedule 7 forms </strong></p>
  <p>    73. (1) The Schedule 7 forms are to be used for documents delivered to the registrar under the legislative provisions which are referred to on those forms. </p>
  <p> (2) For some legislative provisions there is more than one Schedule 7 form. The top of a Schedule 7 form refers to the circumstances in which it is to be used.<br>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Welsh language forms </strong></p>
  <p>    74. (1) Each form in Part 2 of Schedule 7 is partly in Welsh and partly in English and can be used instead of a form in Part 1 of Schedule 7 where the form relates to a Welsh LLP.</p>
  <p> (2) In this rule-</p>
  <ul class="noBullet">
    <li> "Welsh LLP" has the meaning given to it in regulation 17 of the LLP Regulations 2009.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Continuation forms</strong></p>
  <p> 75. (1) Some of the Schedule 7 forms are continuation forms for other Schedule 7 forms. The top of a continuation form refers to "continuation page".</p>
  <p> (2) A continuation form is to be used to continue the information inserted in a Schedule 7 form in the circumstances indicated on that Schedule 7 form. Where there is more than one continuation form for a particular Schedule 7 form the type of information to be continued determines which continuation form is to be used.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Reproduction of a Schedule 7 form</strong></p>
  <p>    76. (1) Subject to rule [78], a document for which a Schedule 7 form must be used must be reproduced as set out in Schedule 7 as to its text, layout and format and must be in black ink.</p>
  <p> (2) Subject to rule [78], a Schedule 7 form must be on paper that complies with the following requirements- </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Size:	A4 </li>
    <li> Colour:	White</li>
    <li> Orientation:	Portrait   (Shorter edge across the top)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Barcode on some Schedule 7 forms which contain a usual residential address </strong></p>
  <p>    77. (1) This rule applies to a form in Part 1 or Part 2 of Schedule 7 which is required by these rules to be used to deliver a document which is required by the LLP Act to contain the usual residential address of a member of an LLP.</p>
  <p> (2) A Schedule 7 form to which this rule applies must contain the barcode indicated on that form in Schedule 7.</p>
  <p> (3) A person reproducing that form for delivery to the registrar can obtain an image of the barcode from the registrar.</p>
  <p> (4) The barcode must be included in the Schedule 7 form in the format supplied by the registrar including it being in black ink, 13.5 mm high and 70.5 mm wide.</p>
  <p> (5) The barcode must be set out in the location indicated on the Schedule 7 form being as follows-</p>
  <ul class="noBullet">
    <li> (a) 41mm from the left edge of the page,</li>
    <li> (b) 47.5mm from the top edge of the page,</li>
    <li> (c) 236mm from the bottom of the page; and </li>
    <li> (d) 98.55mm from the right edge of the page.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Orange coloured forms to be obtained from the registrar</strong></p>
  <p>    78. A document for which a form is provided in Part 3 of Schedule 7 must be delivered to the registrar on a form obtained from the registrar because the form must be on orange coloured paper. <br>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Use of black ink for text inserted in a Schedule 7 form</strong></p>
  <p>    79. Text inserted in a Schedule 7 form must be in black typescript or handwritten in black ink.</p>
  <p><strong>Name and registered number</strong></p>
